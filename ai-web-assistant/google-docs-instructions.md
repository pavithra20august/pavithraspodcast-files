## Alternative Methods to Try:

2. Use Ctrl+V to paste (if text was copied to clipboard)

### Manual Method 2: Voice Typing

2. Click the microphone icon
3. Say the text you want to add

### Manual Method 3: Direct Typing

## Extension-Specific Tips:

- **Try simpler instructions**: Instead of "Add 'hello world' to the document", try "Write hello world"
- **Make sure document is loaded**: Wait for Google Docs to fully load before using the extension
- **Check document permissions**: Make sure you have edit permissions
- **Try refreshing**: Sometimes refreshing the document and trying again helps

## Why Google Docs is Challenging:

Google Docs uses a complex virtual rendering system and doesn't use standard HTML input methods. The extension tries multiple approaches but may not always succeed due to Google's security restrictions.

# Feedback Loop AI Model

A simple Python implementation of an AI model that learns from feedback to improve its predictions over time. This model demonstrates the core concepts of reinforcement learning and feedback loops in AI systems.

## üöÄ Features

- **Learning from Feedback**: The model adjusts its behavior based on positive/negative feedback
- **Memory Management**: Stores experiences and performance history
- **Confidence Tracking**: Maintains confidence levels based on recent performance
- **Model Persistence**: Save and load trained models
- **Performance Analytics**: Track improvement trends and statistics
- **Flexible Input**: Handles variable-length input data

## üìã Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- NumPy

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## üéØ Usage

### Basic Usage

```python
from feedback_ai_model import FeedbackAIModel

# Initialize the model
model = FeedbackAIModel(learning_rate=0.1)

# Make a prediction
input_data = [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1.0]
prediction, confidence = model.predict(input_data)

# Provide feedback (score between -1 and 1)
feedback_score = 0.8  # Positive feedback
model.receive_feedback(input_data, prediction, feedback_score, "positive")

# Check performance
stats = model.get_performance_stats()
print(f"Average performance: {stats['average_score']:.3f}")
```

### Running the Demo

```bash
python feedback_ai_model.py
```

This will run a demonstration showing:
- Model training with various feedback scenarios
- Performance tracking over time
- Testing with new inputs
- Model saving and loading

## üîß How It Works

### Core Components

1. **Prediction Engine**: Uses a simple linear model with sigmoid activation
2. **Feedback Loop**: Updates model weights based on feedback scores
3. **Memory System**: Stores experiences and performance history
4. **Confidence Mechanism**: Adjusts confidence based on recent performance

### Learning Process

1. **Input Processing**: Normalizes input data to match model dimensions
2. **Prediction**: Generates prediction and confidence score
3. **Feedback Reception**: Receives feedback score (-1 to 1)
4. **Weight Update**: Adjusts model weights using gradient descent
5. **Performance Tracking**: Updates confidence and performance metrics

### Feedback Scoring

- **1.0**: Excellent performance (reinforce behavior)
- **0.5**: Good performance (slight reinforcement)
- **0.0**: Neutral (no change)
- **-0.5**: Poor performance (slight correction)
- **-1.0**: Very poor performance (significant correction)

## üìä Model Statistics

The model tracks several performance metrics:

- **Total Experiences**: Number of feedback interactions
- **Average Score**: Overall performance across all feedback
- **Recent Average**: Performance in last 10 interactions
- **Confidence**: Current model confidence level
- **Improvement Trend**: Whether performance is improving over time

## üíæ Model Persistence

```python
# Save the model
model.save_model("my_model.json")

# Load the model
model = FeedbackAIModel()
model.load_model("my_model.json")
```

## üé® Customization

### Adjusting Learning Rate

```python
# Faster learning (more aggressive updates)
model = FeedbackAIModel(learning_rate=0.2)

# Slower learning (more conservative updates)
model = FeedbackAIModel(learning_rate=0.05)
```

### Memory Management

```python
# Store more experiences
model = FeedbackAIModel(memory_size=2000)

# Store fewer experiences (saves memory)
model = FeedbackAIModel(memory_size=500)
```

## üî¨ Example Applications

This feedback loop model can be adapted for various applications:

- **Recommendation Systems**: Learn user preferences
- **Content Filtering**: Improve filtering based on user feedback
- **Quality Assessment**: Learn to predict quality scores
- **Anomaly Detection**: Adapt to changing patterns
- **Personalization**: Customize responses based on feedback

## üß™ Extending the Model

### Adding New Features

```python
class ExtendedFeedbackModel(FeedbackAIModel):
    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)
        self.additional_features = {}
    
    def predict(self, input_data):
        # Add custom preprocessing
        processed_input = self._preprocess(input_data)
        return super().predict(processed_input)
    
    def _preprocess(self, input_data):
        # Add your custom preprocessing logic
        return input_data
```

### Custom Feedback Types

```python
# Use different feedback types for different scenarios
model.receive_feedback(input_data, prediction, 0.8, "user_preference")
model.receive_feedback(input_data, prediction, -0.3, "quality_control")
model.receive_feedback(input_data, prediction, 0.5, "accuracy")
```

## üìà Performance Tips

1. **Start with Moderate Learning Rate**: 0.1 is a good starting point
2. **Provide Consistent Feedback**: Use similar scales for similar scenarios
3. **Monitor Performance**: Check statistics regularly to ensure improvement
4. **Save Models**: Persist trained models to avoid retraining
5. **Clean Data**: Ensure input data is properly normalized
